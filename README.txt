You need fpc to compile this project.
Just call ./make.sh

I did not understand the Makefile.fpc concept of lazarus. The Makefile.fpc's I tried did not produce Makefiles that actually build anything.

This project includes: 
- Doimage ELF i386 binary and source provided by Marvell under GPLv2 (from Netgear ReadyNas DuoV2 GPL sources)
- Synapse pascal communication library source release 40 provided by Lukas Gebauer under the license found in the synapse dir.
