You need fpc to compile this project.

The Makefile.fpc's do not yet produce Makefiles that actually build anything.
So I think you have to install fat lazarus (without the GUI libraries) to build.

This project includes: 
- Doimage ELF i386 binary and source provided by Marvell under GPLv2 (from Netgear ReadyNas DuoV2 GPL sources)
- Synapse pascal communication library source release 40 provided by Lukas Gebauer under the license found in the synapse dir.
